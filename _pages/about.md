Research Interests
======
Smart-city operations:
1. Climate-resilient cities (e.g., seawater intrusion prevention, planning against extreme rainfalls)
2. Agile and autonomous logistics  (e.g., autonomous mobile stores, last-mile crowdshipping, online facility location)
3. Energy, mobility, and their citywide synergy (e.g., energy storage, battery swapping, shared autonomous electric vehicles）
4. Sharing economy (e.g., vehicle sharing,  energy omni-sharing)
